# To-do-list-using-React

This application is a To-Do List built using React that demonstrates the use of React Hooks, especially useState, to manage component state. The app allows users to add and delete tasks dynamically.

The useState hook is used to store the list of tasks and the current input value. When a user enters a task and clicks the Add button, the task is added to the list. Each task is displayed using the map() function and includes a Delete (X) button to remove it.

The UI updates instantly without page refresh due to React’s state-driven rendering. Styling is applied using CSS-in-JS.
